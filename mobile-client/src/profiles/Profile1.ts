Professional Interests

My professional interests include working with couples, groups, and individuals experiencing relationship concerns, adjustment challenges, identity development, self-worth concerns, and depression. I am also interested in working with trauma survivors, body image concerns, and marginalized populations.

Approach to Therapy

I believe that change happens in many ways, but one important ingredient is self-awareness. I work collaboratively with clients to help them reach their goals and increase self-awareness along the way. Her approach to therapy is integrative, drawing on interpersonal process, existential, and cognitive behavioral theories among others.
